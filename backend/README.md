# Project Overview

# We’ll build a Todo App with authentication:

##  Backend (Express + MongoDB) → APIs for auth (register/login/logout) and todo CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

##  Frontend (React) → Login/Register forms, Todo list interface, connect to backend API.

##  Extras → JWT authentication, local storage for tokens, basic styling.

# By the end, you’ll have a complete full-stack project you can deploy or add to your portfolio.
